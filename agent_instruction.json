        "overview": "A comprehensive human pose estimation plugin that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) models to detect and track human poses in real-time. Provides structured pose data with joint coordinates, confidence scores, and visualization components.",
        "key_features": [
            "Real-time human pose detection using ultralytics YOLO models",
            "COCO keypoint format with 17 anatomical landmarks",
            "Configurable confidence thresholds and model selection",
            "Structured data output with Joint, Skeleton, and PoseData classes",
            "GUI visualization component for overlay rendering",
            "Normalized coordinate system for resolution independence",
            "Multiple person detection with bounding box information"
        ]

        "basic_pose_detection": "api = YoloPoseApi(); pose_data = api.detect_poses(frame)",
        "gui_visualization": "gui_pose = GUIPose('pose_overlay'); gui_pose.set_pose_data(pose_data); gui_pose.draw()",
        "confidence_filtering": "Configure confidence_threshold in config to filter low-confidence detections",
        "multi_person_analysis": "Access multiple skeletons via pose_data.skeletons list for crowd analysis",
        "joint_access": "skeleton.joints[0] # Access nose keypoint; joint.x, joint.y # Normalized coordinates"
    },
    "warning": {
        "model_download": "YOLO models are downloaded automatically on first use - ensure internet connectivity and sufficient disk space",
        "gpu_memory": "Large YOLO models (yolov8x-pose.pt) require significant GPU memory - adjust model size based on hardware",
        "confidence_tuning": "Default confidence threshold (0.5) may need adjustment based on lighting conditions and use case",
        "coordinate_normalization": "Joint coordinates are normalized (0-1) - multiply by frame dimensions for pixel coordinates",
        "realtime_performance": "Performance depends on model size and hardware - consider yolov8n-pose.pt for real-time applications"
